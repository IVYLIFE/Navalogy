        title: `Performances of M2M Protocols in Internet of Medical Things" Accepted in IEEE WS16 ICC'2023 Workshop - SIGNIS`,
        description: `The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a constantly developing idea that aims to connect the medical IoT devices used in the  healthcare industry. 
                        IoMT devices use their environment to detect, collect and send vital information about the medical parameters  of a user/patient. 
                        This data can be then used for health monitoring of patients remotely and predicting their health conditions. Now, in order to transmit this huge 
                        amount of data and information IoT devices need to adopt certain machine-to-machine (M2M) communication protocols. In IoMT,
                        it is very much crucial to choose the right protocol for the communication of critical data. In this paper, we are evaluating the performances of the 
                        four most widely used M2M protocols such as - Message Queuing Telemetry Transport Protocol (MQTT), Advanced Message Queuing Protocol 
                        (AMQP), Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), in terms of packet size and Round 
                        Trip Time (RTT) which are two essential factors in terms of transmission of medical data. Performances of these protocols are tested in an IoMT kit developed using several medical as well as general purpose sensors. We also compare the protocols based on their security and QoS features for their suitability to IoMT. Based on the experimental results and feature comparisons, MQTT proves to be the most suitable M2M protocol for IoMT.`,

        title: `"iRASA: Fog Scheduling With Congregation of MVO and PSO" in IEEE I3CS-2023 Awarded 2nd Prize Under Best Paper Category in I3CS-2023`,
        description: `Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system that monitors and analyses the network traffic for detecting the malicious activities and attacks. 
                        IDS can be classified into two types: Misuse Detection System (MDS) and Anomaly Detection System (ADS). MDS is based on the signature database 
                        and it can detect only the known attacks. ADS is based on the normal behaviour of the network and it can detect both known and unknown attacks. 
                        Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used in ADS for detecting the unknown attacks. In this paper, we have surveyed the ML techniques used in ADS 
                        for detecting the unknown attacks. We have also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the ML techniques used in ADS.`,
